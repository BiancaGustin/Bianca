<p style="text-align: center;">Fifa rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein</p>
<h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li>
    The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the ideals 
    of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
    detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of 
    technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>
        <p> <strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong>
                    FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given
                    maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields
                    used by teams under 12 and older.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong>
                    Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations 
                        participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assignn its Fields Committee 
                        to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions
                        should be granted.Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                        field may be required to play all their games away.</p></li>
    <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</strong>
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
                 <li>  U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older age groups
                        should be progressively larger.</li>
                    <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                   <li> U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width</li>
                   <li> In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions and 
                    size of goal similarly modified.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
</ol>

        Coaches in the competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.</li></ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
